Failstream
----------

[Failstream](https://twitch.tv/failstream) was the whole reason I began this project, so a huge thank you to him.  He provided a lot of testing (whether he knew it or not) that I did not have time to do, as it would have required hours of my own gameplay.

Fail is best known for [Fail's Floatilla : Final Flight](https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/154E-0000-0358-C2FB) aka *The Impossible Cape Level*, a Super Mario Maker level that took him 482+ hours to beat.  <span class="text-muted">(Arguably.  Some would argue he's better known for his Van Gogh level skill at hand-crafting emotes like :failsSelfie:.)</span>

Watch his clear video (nsfw language), see how awesome he is, and then follow him on [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/failstream)!

He has also offered to create the Tutorial videos for the tool and host them on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWpNIjmFZ0YFYRovw-tMIA), which is great for three reasons:

1.  I don't have to make the videos
2.  His channel has actual followers, providing exposure for this tool that I could never achieve
3.  He's a lot better at speaking than I am -- that's probably more important to you than to me

[iIPK](https://twitch.tv/iipk) has also been instrumental in testing the SoulLink functionality and has been super patient working through the kinks of setting up and updating the tool, so a special thanks to him.

Resources
---------

#### Discord.JS ####

[Discord.JS](http://discord.js.org) is a library for accessing Discord via NodeJS.  Without it, I could not have implemented automatic SoulLinking.

#### Pokémon Technicals ####

I don't know if you can credit an entire wiki, but [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net) provided much of the technical details on how to access and decrypt memory.

Much of the data (such as static encounters) I pulled from the [PKHeX project](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/29182-pkhex-gen-1-7-savpkm-editor/) ([source](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX)), a *comprehensive* tool for viewing, editing, and creating pokémon that can be (re)loaded into ROMs of every generation to date.  This saved me literally days worth of research and data entry.

#### Images ####

The large sprite images I used in this project, and have suggested in the Setup documentation that you use were provided by [Typhlosion](http://pkmn.net/?action=profile&member=80) and hosted by [pkmn.net](http://pkmn.net/?action=content&page=viewpage&id=8644).

The small sprites included in this project's repository (as I could not figure out how to link a git repository within my own), are provided by [msikma's PokéSprite Image Sprite Generator](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite).  Those sprites are used in the Dashboard, and will be used in the Graveyard if I ever get around to it.
